### Introduction

Solutions with tests, tips and tutorials for <a href="https://www.codewars.com">Codewars</a> katas.
Almost every kata has a long solution and a shorter one, IMHO a long descriptive solution it's preferred over a cryptic one-liner, unless it's understandable for your entire team.

### Disclaimer

- Codewarriors are strongly encouraged not to look at your solutions to Kata until they have completed it themselves or at least took the time to think about their own approaches

* Codewarriors should not submit your solutions as their own

- You will not be accepting contributions of any form to this repo

* Creating a repository like this is discouraged by Codewars

### Vocabulary

- Kata: is an algorithm you have to solve in any programming language you desire

- Kyu: is a digit that determines kata difficulty level as well as the user rank on the platform

### Purpose

Practicing katas could help you to improve your algorithmic thinking. It could also help at interviews being more confident and learning a few tricks of your preferred language.

### Repository Structure

There's a folder for each kata nested in its own kyu

```ascii
├── 6-kyu/
│   ├── README.md 
│   ├── excercise_name 
│   │   ├── main.py
│   │   └── test.py
